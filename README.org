** Contributing

Checkout the source code and build the project in a =guix shell= with
GNU Autotools.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # Obtain the source code
  git clone https://github.com/asahi-guix/maintenance.git
  cd maintenance
  guix shell -Df guix.scm
  # In the new shell, run:
  autoreconf -vif && ./configure && make check
#+END_SRC

You may also want to set your directory as an authorized directory for
=guix shell= so it works without arguments. To do that, simply run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  echo $(pwd) >> $HOME/.config/guix/shell-authorized-directories
#+END_SRC

You can now hack this project's files to your heart's content, whilst
testing them from your =guix shell= shell.

To try out any scripts in the project you can now use

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ./pre-inst-env scripts/${script-name}
#+END_SRC
