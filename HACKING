#+TITLE: Hacking Asahi Guix Maintenance

* Contributing

By far the easiest way to hack on Asahi Guix Maintenance is to develop using Guix:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # Obtain the source code
  git clone https://github.com/asahi-guix/maintenance.git
  cd maintenance
  guix shell -Df guix.scm
  # In the new shell, run:
  autoreconf -vif && ./configure && make check
#+END_SRC

You may also want to set your directory as an authorized directory for
`guix shell' so it works without arguments. To do that, simply run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  echo $(pwd) >> $HOME/.config/guix/shell-authorized-directories
#+END_SRC

You can now hack this project's files to your heart's content, whilst
testing them from your `guix shell' shell.

To try out any scripts in the project you can now use

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ./pre-inst-env scripts/${script-name}
#+END_SRC

** Manual Installation

If you do not yet use  Guix, you will have to install this project's
dependencies manually:
  - autoconf
  - automake
  - pkg-config
  - texinfo

Once those dependencies are installed you can run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  autoreconf -vif && ./configure && make check
#+END_SRC
